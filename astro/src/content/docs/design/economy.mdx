This scenario will include a few additional mechanisms to address the unique economic aspects that this scenario discusses.

## Available Credit

The other large impact that the EIC had on Britain (and Europe as a whole) is the [Credit Crisis that occured in the early 1770s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_credit_crisis_of_1772%E2%80%931773). This high amount of debt in both the Government and the Company was a large motivation for the Tea Act.

The thought is that there will be some limited amount of Credit that is available for all players:
- Firms
- Company
- Government

Any time that any of these reach into debt, it will pull from this stack of available credit.

The initial pressure will be low, as there will seem to be plenty of credit. However, as it starts to run down, there will be incentive for all of the Firms, Company and Government to stop using as much of the credit pool. This current implementation is a bit boardgame-y, however, the pressure is designed to lightly simulate the credit crisis that Britian experienced in the 1770s.

:::note
Similar to India, sustaing a military presence is what will cause the most debt. This would follow suit in America. Historically, the Seven Years War/French and Indian War doubled the national debt in Britain.

### Backstop for Firms

The scenario wants (at least) one firm throughout the scenario, involved in the 13 Colonies. The firms in John Company are fragile and without additional credit (workshops or Company shares in good standing), any firm with a bad trade roll or two can shut down.

By allowing the firms this additional investment opportunity, it will hopefully keep a good percentage of the (unlucky) firms solvent during the initial turns of the scenario (if not the entire scenario). To make sure that this doesn't eliminate the ability for players to negotiate investment, the penalty for needing credit to keep functioning should be significant.

## Government Budget

The British Government implemented the tariffs to try to pay for the costs of the military, judges, clergy and other government offices in the Colonies. To simulate this, the money from the tariffs will be the income to pay for the military and debts occurred during gameplay. The administrative costs will be represented by additional tokens, but will be counted like debt.

In a similar fashion to the costs of the Company, each cardboard token should represent a cost of £1 for the Colonial budget of the Government, either debt, army or administratino.

Anytime the Government needs money, it can takes some of the publicly available credit. Unlike the Company or Firms, there is no different "emergency loan" difference.

## Firms (in America)

The trade orders in America will have less financial value than the orders in India (typically £3-4). Tariffs will also impact the Firms, both in closing orders and directly reducing revenue from their trades. In addition, the firms will also be competing with each other, as well as smugglers, for the orders on trades.

To account for this lower income, the following mechanisms are being considered to provide an income boost:

### Tea

The tea that comes from the Tea Auction provides a small income increase. Tea will be sold per region, getting a profit per order in that region. When selling tea, the unrest in that region will be subtracted from the die.

This incentivizes a couple of things:
1. This encourages firms to trade more in a specific region, providing character to the colonial landscape.
2. This makes selling Tea a risk/reward scenario: The Firms can profit from it by adding more risk. The available credit backstop means that the Firms can lean into more risk without defaulting.
3. Tea is also taxed, meaning that the "Colonial Office" also benefits from the sale.

This creates a "loyalist" tension among the firms to add Tea to try to raise additional funding for themselves and the Government. This bonus would transfer from the Firms to the Company when _Tea Regulation_ is enabled.

### Plantations

Another thought is to add an additional enterprise: plantations. Plantations would be associated with a specific region or commodity, gaining a bonus when trade takes place there, and being an expense when trade doesn't take place there. Plantations are strictly financial, and would not provide votes or other benefits.

Having plantations in America would invest players more in that map, as when certain orders are closed, it would affect Plantation owners directly. Plantations could tie in nicely with some of the specific regulations available (Sugar Act, Tobacco Act, Iron Act).
